What are Database Triggers?
- SQL statements that are AUTOMATICALLY RUN when a specific table is changed

Syntax:
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name
    trigger_time trigger_event ON table_name FOR EACH ROW
    BEGIN
    ....
    END;

trigger_time = before, after
trigger_event = insert, update, delete
table_name = photos, users, etc..

Why use this?
- validating data (not best use)
  ex. only allow insert data in table if age > 18
